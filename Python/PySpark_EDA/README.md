# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Different Datasets

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) repository! This repository contains a collection of notebooks and code snippets for performing EDA on various datasets. Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step in any data analysis or machine learning project, as it helps us understand the data, identify patterns, and gather insights that guide further analysis.

## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that demonstrate how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on different datasets. EDA involves techniques for summarizing the main characteristics of the data, visualizing the data's structure, and identifying potential patterns or outliers.

## Datasets

The following datasets have been included in this repository for EDA:

1. [MetroPT3](data/MetroPT3): The dataset contains readings collected from the Air Production Unit (APU) of a metro train in an operational context. The APU is equipped with sensors that measure various parameters including pressure, temperature, motor current, and air intake valves. These readings provide valuable insights into the condition of the APU and can be used to address predictive maintenance challenges in the industry.

2. [Higher Education Students Performance Evaluation](data/StudentEvaluation): The dataset was collected from students enrolled in the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Educational Sciences in the year 2019. The main objective of collecting this data is to leverage machine learning techniques for predicting students' end-of-term performances.
